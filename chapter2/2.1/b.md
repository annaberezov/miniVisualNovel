I decide to try and talk to Alex about the tasks. He seems quiet but I am sure for work, he would answer my questions.
He is sitting at his desk with his headphones on. 

- Tap him on the shoulder to get his attention
    - ["Hey Alex, do you mind if I ask you about the project?"](./2.1.b/a.md)
    - ["Alex, what's up? Do you have a minute to chat? I have some questions about the project"](./2.1.b/b.md)
- [Just walk up to his desk and wait until he notices you and says something first.](./2.1.b/c.md)
