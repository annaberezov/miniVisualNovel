I decide to sit down and start reading through this thick folder of papers. First seems to be a project outline. 

“Meet the new AI assistant who will do all the work and tasks you hate to do!” sounds like a tall order for a product but also sounds interesting. 

The stack of papers seem to never end as I go from page to page, powerpoint to powerpoint, excel sheet to excel sheet, until I reach a sheet filled with dates bolded, underlined, and highlighted. 

I guess there are the deadlines Edward said I can’t miss, no matter what. Under each date is a list of tasks which need to be completed and signed off on. 

There is a mix of technical tasks, writing code, documentation, etc… and a list of more business topics: creating powerpoints, meeting with customers, things like that. 

I guess I should see what my other coworkers are working on so I can figure out what work I should be doing…
