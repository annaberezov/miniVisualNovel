# No wonder the job description was so empty…

    Edward: So, here is your office Y/N. 

Edward gestures to a giant curved desk, topped with 3 (!!!) monitors, a mechanical keyboard, some ergonomic looking mouse, and what seems to be the most expensive and hopefully comfortable office chair I have seen in my life.  

The rest of the room is not heavily populated as there are only two other desks with similar setups, absolutely no plants or decor, and floor to wall closets which are all shut and probably locked. 

The room looks brand new but somehow at the same time like it has not been touched in years…  

    Edward: Your other coworkers will join you shortly, they should be finishing up their lunch break. 

And as if on cue, the same beep sound radiates from the door behind me and with the same thud, the door is opened.  

In walks two guys, both looking around the same age as me.  

One of them is dressed in brown slacks and a dark blue button down shirt which looks so crisp you could cut yourself on its sleeve. He has wavy blond hair that somehow achieves that perfect “messy” look that you only find in magazine spreads and sharp green eyes which seem to be scanning you, judging you. 

The other one wears a black hoodie and dark wash jeans. Dark brown heavy hair frames his face almost perfectly, complementing his deep blue eyes which wander around the room, never settling on anything for more than a few seconds. 

    Edward: Perfect timing... Y/N, this is Eric and Alex. The three of you will be working together as a team. 

The blonde extends his hand out for my second business handshake of the day.

	Eric: Eric, looking forward to working with you

His smile seems a little forced and his voice strained but that could also be me overthinking things. 

Alex just waves towards me as he heads towards his desk. I guess he is not really one for conversation...

    Y/N: So… what exactly will I be working on?

Edward pulls out a folder maybe 2 or 3 cm thick and hands it to me.

    Edward: Everything you need to know about the project is in here along with current deadlines, tasks, and any other important information you may need. I will not be interfearing with your day to day work much, but there are a couple rules which I follow strictly. First, you CANNOT miss any deadlines under no circumstances. No excuse will be permitted. Second, You cannot speak about the work you do here outside of the office, not with anyone. Not your mom, your cat, your pet rock. I do not care, it says within these four walls. And finally, you cannot modify the office. No new furniture, no new equipment, nothing. If you have any questions, feel free to ask your coworkers first.

And with a final stern look, Edward turns on his heel and shows himself out of the room.

Welp. Now it’s just me, these two other guys, and a lot of reading.
