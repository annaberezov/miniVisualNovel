# Chapter 1: How Did I End Up in a Basement?!
I am practically skipping through the streets as the morning sun bounces off of skyscraper windows and settles into green trees, stone statues, park squares, and honking cars.  
This is really the perfect day.  
I stop in front of a giant, 100 story tall building that seems to reach beyond the clouds above. My first day at my dream tech company, Technolite. I spent the past 6 years slaving over my university degrees, working at different internships, doing research, everything I could manage to end up here.  
It’s been my dream since I was a little girl, working at Technolite, developing the newest technology to change the world. Yes, I know it sounds very cheesy and kind of gross but it’s true.  
Now I know that whatever I do will not be on the cover of any large magazines or be the next social media explosion, but it will be something cool.  
The job application did not say much beyond “AI expert who can handle development as well as project management. Needs to be flexible with working hours and socially proficient. Communication skills are a must!”  
I mean I did not need much convincing to apply, even if the listing seems a little suspicious… but, the interview process seemed relatively normal! After 2 in-person interviews, a technical examination, and a mental health examination (not too sure what that one was for) I got a job at my dream company!  
As I walk through the large glass rotating doors, a pristine blue and white lobby greets me. A marble topped front desk awaits me with the most typically beautiful woman one can imagine sitting behind it.  
I confidently walk up to the desk, ready to get this new adventure started!  
With an almost too sweet tone of voice, the woman greets me:  

    Tristany: Hello and welcome to Technolite’s main office, my name is Tristany, how may I assist you? 

Tristany, definitely somehow fits to her platinum blonde hair and paper white teeth.  
    
- [Y/N: Hi. It’s my first day working here…My name is Y/N and I got an email telling me to check in at the front desk.](./1.1/a.md)
- [Y/N: Good Morning! It is my first day and I need to get my ID and everything.](./1.1/b.md)
- [Y/N: Are you a cyborg?](./1.1/c.md)

I take the badge from her and follow her directions to the T. After taking my mugshot I mean headshot for my new ID, I look at it now sitting in my hands. All my hard work has started paying off.  
This is really happening. This really IS the perfect day. 
After going from security, to IT, back to security, and sitting through some boring orientation meetings (I don’t really need to worry about my pension right now anyways…. right?) it's time to finally meet my team and find out what work I will be doing.  
As I wait outside the meeting room where the orientation meeting ended, I hold my new laptop tightly to my chest as I start to feel nervous. All the other new hires who joined today are already gone, picked up by their work buddies, managers, or both even.  
As I stand there, I alternate looking between the somehow perfect green plant, the light gray carpeted floors, and the view of a small park outside the window. Until I hear heavy and slow footsteps come towards me.  
A tall man in a dark gray suit with a crisp white shirt and a solid black tie walks towards me. His jet black hair slicked back so tight you would think it was a helmet and not a hairdo.  

    Edward: Y/N. Welcome to Technolite. My name is Edward. I am your new manager.

As he reaches me, he extends a hand out for a handshake. The moment our hands join, his grip and his eye contact are so intense it feels like my soul is slowly leaving my body.  
His eyes so gray and cold, they look like two stones floating, staring right at you.  

[Y/N: H-h-hello, yes, thank you.](./chapter1.md)

Edward: I apologize for being a little late. A meeting with some customers ran longer than anticipated. Please, follow me. I will show you to your office.
I follow slightly behind Edward and take in the office as we walk. There are long desks with around 10 monitors on them, different people sitting there working. Some in calls, some working in silence, and some looking at their phones. We stop for a moment in front of an elevator and Edward presses the down button. We both step into the elevator and I wonder which floor I will work on. Of course I cannot expect to be too high up since I am just starting but a nice city view would be a plus! Maybe something like the 20th floor could be nice. Not too high and not too low. But instead, he presses the bottom button, below the lobby. As we make the long descent from the 54th floor, the ride seems to never end. Until finally, we reached, the basement?! As we step out of the elevator, I am greeted with fluorescent lighting making me feel like I am either in a prison or a hospital (which cannot be possible right?!) There is just a straight, long hallway which seems to extend indefinitely past Edward. He peeks over his shoulder to ensure that I also got out of the elevator and begins to walk down the hall. At the beginning of the walk, offices on both side of the hallway are filled with the sound of keyboards clicking, people discussing, and just general office sounds. But the longer we walk, the less noise there seems to be, and less people. Until, we reach the end of the hall. Not a single drop of natural sunlight can be found here. The gray carpet now looks much darker and ominous than it did 55 floors higher. A large metal door stands in front of the both of us.
	Edward: Please use your ID to open the door so we can ensure it is working properly.
Y/N: Y-y-yes of course!
As I reach my ID towards the small, plastic gray square embedded into the wall, I feel a chill run down my spine. The little plastic pad beeps and the metal door unlocks with a large thud and Edward pushes the door open. A cool breeze seems to escape from the door and I feel goosebumps run across my skin. What have I gotten myself into and how did I end up in a basement?!
