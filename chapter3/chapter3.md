# Just the Four of Us

As I walk into the office the next day, I run into Alex and Eric also on their way in. The three of us get into the elevator and start our dark journey to our office. 
- [Try to talk with Alex](./3.1/a.md)
- [Try to talk with Eric](./3.1/b.md)
- [Stay silent](./3.1/c.md)

Once we reach our office, Alex pulls open the metal door and we all head straight to our desks, there is a ton to do. As I sit down to start working, I notice that the F key is no longer on my keyboard. Before I can say anything, Eric calls out to the room

	Eric: OK guys, very funny. Who took my E key from my keyboard?

It's obvious that despite his giggles, Eric is quite annoyed by this...

- [“Someone also took the F from my keyboard”](./3.2/a.md)
- [“It was Alex, I am also missing the F from my keyboard”](./3.2/b.md)
- [“It was not me. The F from my keyboard is missing too”](./3.2/c.md)
- [“My F is missing too. Alex, are you missing anything?”](./3.2/d.md)


We all left the office at the same time yesterday, and no one says they came in again between leaving and us all walking in together this morning… the only other person who has access to this room is Edward and I really doubt that he is the kind of guy to play pranks on people, especially not in the office… So that means it has to be one of us three, there is no one else that could do this… How do we solve this?

- [“Maybe it was Edward who did this.”](./3.3/a.md)
- [“Let’s just look for the keys, does not matter who did this”](./3.3/b.md)
- [“We are not doing anything until one of you confesses that you did this”](./3.3/c.md)

As we looked around the office, opening all drawers, looking under desks, we could not find the keys anywhere. After a solid half hour of looking for them, we decide to quit and just get back to work.

	Y/N: The key is back!

You see on your keyboard that all the keys are there, but in the place where an F should be, it’s just a blank key… 

	Y/N: But the key is blank…
	Eric: It’s the same with my E key. There is a key but its blank.
	Alex: Same here…

Something seriously weird is going on here. Anyways, with a good chunk of time wasted, it was time to get back to work. But, my monitors are not turning on. I try unplugging the wire and plugging it back in again… Still nothing. Well, that’s odd. They are not even turning on. I duck underneath my desk and notice that the power cable for the monitors is unplugged. I don’t remember unplugging them, I don’t even remember ever being under my desk. I mean yesterday was my first day afterall…

- [Don’t mention it to anyone](./3.4/a.md)
- [“Hey, did someone unplug my monitors?”](./3.4/b.md)

I decided not to mention it since we already lost so much time trying to solve the missing keys incident. So I just get back to work. 
After a solid couple hours of work, I feel my stomach calling for food.

- [Ask if the group wants to get lunch together](./3.5/a.md)
- [Ask Alex to get lunch together](./3.5/b.md)
- [Ask Eric to get lunch together](./3.5/c.md)

We all head to lunch together.
After a nice meal of salad, croquettes, and some handmade pasta, the stress and weird activities from the morning seem to magically escape my mind. The three of us make our way back to our tucked away corner of the building. As I beep my badge and push the office door open, my jaw drops. All of our desks, monitors, keyboard, mice, and even office chairs are covered in gift wrapping paper! My station was covered in deep purple wrapping paper with my favorite character plastered all over it; Wamiji. What can I say, his thin long legs and his long pointy mustache are just too cute! Alex’s desk is covered in paper with tons of different horses on them. There are so many different types of horses, I didn’t even know there were so many types of horses…. Eric’s paper is light pink with tons of adorable teddy bears all over it. Our office definitely looks more colorful than it was before, but who did this?!

Ghost is cute and wears a monocle and a bowtie.
