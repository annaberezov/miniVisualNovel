Alex seems caught off guard by the sudden excitement radiating from my question. He give me a quizzicle look before responding:

    Alex: "Uh.. yeah... I guess so..."

I guess that was kind of an odd question to ask but it's too late now... He does not seem too interested in keeping the conversation going.

We continue our journey together in silence. As we reach the office, I cannot help but wonder why we are in such a hidden part of the building? And why are there basically no people that work over here?
