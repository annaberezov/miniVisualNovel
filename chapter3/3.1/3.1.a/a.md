Alex gives you a bit of a questioning sideways look. He remains silent for a few seconds. Then finally

    Alex: "It was pretty good..."

And back to silence... I guess he is not really one for conversation. But at least it sounds like his evening was nothing crazy. At least I hope he was telling the truth...

We continue our journey together in silence. As we reach the office, I cannot help but wonder why we are in such a hidden part of the building? And why are there basically no people that work over here?
