Eric seems a little irritated by my enthusiasm and question but he responds with a smile

    Eric: "About as excited as I can be on a Tuesday morning."

I am not too sure how to respond to that so I let out a little polite laugh and decide to leave the conversation there.

We continue our journey together in silence. As we reach the office, I cannot help but wonder why we are in such a hidden part of the building? And why are there basically no people that work over here?
