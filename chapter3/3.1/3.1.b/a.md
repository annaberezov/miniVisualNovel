Eric smiles his somehow perfect smile at me and responds

    Eric: "My evening was lovely thank you for asking. I hope yours was as well?"

I can't help but only nod as his response ends with a smile which seems to read "please don't ask any further questions" so I get the memo and leave him be.

We continue our journey together in silence. As we reach the office, I cannot help but wonder why we are in such a hidden part of the building? And why are there basically no people that work over here?
