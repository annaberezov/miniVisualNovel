writing for a mini visual novel

Rough Idea:
Office setting. You work as a software developer in a big tech company and you are starting out in this small team that runs a research kind of project. There are only 2 other people that you work with, the other super technical guy and the business / project running guy. They also were just assigned to this project and to this office. The technical guy is obviously quiet and does not talk alot. The business guy talks a lot and likes to talk. You were assigned to this team to develop an application or something and you get to choose if you want to do more technical work or more business work. Oh but the guy is the opposite of the work you choose to do. So if you pick to do more business work, you end up with the tech guy and vice versa. 

Fun plot twist is the office you work in is haunted but the ghost is really cute and friendly. It starts by playing “pranks” on the protagonist which she thinks is the guys doing it but then they find out its haunted and the ghost does not do like mean spooky stuff but funny spooky stuff.

The ghost is a bonus route where he helps spook everyone and you become the CEO of the company lol

Routes:
Tech route good ending
Tech route neutral ending
Tech route bad ending

Business route good ending
Business route neutral ending
Business route bad ending

Ghost special ending good
Ghost special ending bad -> ghost is ghostbusted somehow

Good endings -> romantic ending with the guy of the route
Neutral endings -> no romantic ending but all goes well
Bad endings -> unromantic ending with guy and everything fails lol

Characters:
Protagonist
Tech Guy
Business Guy
Manager - Super intense about work and serious. No relationships allowed in the office, deadlines have to be met, i dont care how long you have to work, etc..
Ghost

Location:
Some large tech company in the basement in some hidden room kinda thing tucked away. The office is totally new and equipped but it seems to be untouched for a while… no one seems to want to go to this part of the basement.
